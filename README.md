# Agnes Readme
MERN stack staffing solutions software

Due to difficulties in deployment and factors such as mLabs the client and server side of the app were seperated into their own repos.

Client: https://github.com/RyanG91/agnes-client

Server: https://github.com/RyanG91/agnes-server

Heroku Link: https://agnes-client.herokuapp.com/

## Project Management

#### 1) Record interactions with your client in a diary format:
The diary format with the client conducted through weekly updates after the first meeting on Tuesday July 3rd with our group emailing them each Monday. Email was used as the main form of communication, due to difficulty of team members going to the location of the client. The emails informed the client of the app’s progress with screenshots and responses from the client saying if they approved of the app / progress as well as asking to add other features.

July 3rd - Meet with the client with two app ideas to pitch to them. They liked our second idea and wanted our team to design a human management style system to manage their rosters, timesheets and staff. Meeting lasted about 1 hour.

July 9th - Client is emailed with the basic pictures of how we designed the app and asked for their feedback. Clients were overall impressed with the design and asked if it would be possible to add a fortnight reference for staff and the use of a participant sign-in / out using an Ipad.

July 16th - Client is updated with our progress along with pictures showing our progress. Received positive feedback and continued with the progress.

July 23rd - Client is informed about the teams progress and that we will be finishing on Friday.

#### 2) Plan information gathering activities to determine project requirements, constraints and risks:

Information gathering activities were undertaken after meeting with the client for the first time. Using whiteboards we gathered the information which would be needed to build our app. The main requirements would be the need to have different components which could talk to each other, to the database while at the same time able to be updated regularly. 

Component tree designed after information gathering:

#### 3) Develop project charter, including preliminary statement of project scope and obtain sign-off:
Goals:
* Create a human management application
* MVP objectives by the 26th July
* Scope:
* * 3 weeks to build the project
* * Only 4 developers to work on the project
* * We have a verbal agreement from the client to build this app for them

Objective:
* Our app aims to create application for our client which to assist in their human management system.
* Create a Roster page which will allow the client to create roster pages, edit them or flag staff, depending on when they login/off, while allowing staff to see when they are rostered on to work.
* Create a Timesheet page which will allow the client to review the completed hours of staff. It will also allow staff to see their completed hours, based off the roster and when they have clocked in/out.
* Create a clock on/off system which will flag staff depending on when they clock on, the rostered time and update timesheets.

Stakeholders:
* Team members (Jordan, Jeff, Revel, & Ryan):
* * Responsible for creating the application for this project.
* * Roles were assigned by team members selecting a part of the project they were interested in: Jordan - Node and Staff, Revel - Rosters and Timesheets, Ryan - Keypad and Clocking, Jeff - CSS and styling.
* Coder Academy Staff:
* * Responsible for marking and grading the application.
* * Role to assist and provide guidance to the team members working on the app.
* Client:
* * R.O.P.E - Redcliffe Opportunities for People’s Enhancement
* * Our client is an organisation which is aimed at providing people with intellectual disabilities opportunities and choices. They are located in the Redcliffe area and have been around since the 1990’s, has received a number of grants and aim to help individuals up to the age of 35. To contact our client their address is 31 Grace Street, Scarborough 4020, phone number is 07 3880 2533.

#### 4) Prepare project work breakdown and schedule:
The use of online tools such as Trello was used for the project work breakdown and schedule. Below are some examples of how our boards used for breaking down the project work.

Staff Member timesheet:

#### 5) Allocate roles and responsibilities to team members, based on project solution requirements:
The roles and responsibilities were allocated by using different Trello Boards such as Rosters and Timesheets:
![admin 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33079422/43236941-d5bf8d88-90ca-11e8-853c-45670619c9a6.PNG)

#### 6) Monitor each other’s assigned work:
The groups work was monitored through the group chat in Slack, with various bits of code being examined by different team members and arranging times to meet each other.

Example 1:
![image 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33079422/43236994-1586a1ae-90cb-11e8-83eb-5a938f6d7e17.PNG)

Example 2:

#### 7) Reassess ongoing project scope changes, risks and issues:
Over the course of building our app it became clear, it would have have to be sized down and a lot of features we had envisioned such as an undo and redo buttons would have to be placed in the backlog as extras which could be added later. The main decision for sizing down our was because of time constraints and the increasing complexity of the code.

The main risk which our app faced was the need to ensure that the information of the client and their users would be kept protected in accordance with Australian law regarding privacy. To address this problem our app would use Node features such as Passport and tokens.

#### 8) Manage system testing and hand over activities. Prepare maintenance or support plans for client:
The handing over activity which will be undertaken by our group is to have a training session with the client and their users. The aim of these sessions are to run through the app with the users, make them feel comfortable with it and answer any questions they might have. In order to provide further support plans for the client, we have informed them that we are happy for them to inform us of potential bugs/problems which we can address for them. They also have our email addresses and can reach out to our team if necessary.

#### 9) Obtain final project sign-off:
![screenshot_2018-07-25-18-25-18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33079422/43237133-d38ec082-90cb-11e8-8b7d-6bd1915c1c78.png)

#### 10) As a team, conduct post project review:
Lessons Learned:
* In regards to the scope, one of the biggest lessons our group has learned is how fast time can move and how this caused our app to be sized down. Another major lesson in regards to our scope was our ability to work well, especially when coming together with all of our different code and merging it together.
* Communication was one of the biggest lessons we have learned as a team. Due to factors such as the location of where team members live it proved difficult at times to come together to assess the progress of our app. The use of programs such as Slack proved to be very useful, enabling our group to constantly remain in contact and aware of each others progress.
* Working when working with the client one of the biggest lessons the interview itself. The interview allowed our team to understand the importance of asking questions to know how to build the app. Even after the interview and over the course of the 3 weeks, our team constantly found ourselves needing to ask more questions to the client about different aspects of the app. In the future our team will be much more aware about the need to ask questions but to also ensure that the app is being built the way our client envisioned.
* The agile process was something our team needs to work on in the future. After meeting with the client, all team members were excited to dive straight into building the code. After the first week however, it became clear that we needed to have a better strategy if we were going to complete our app on time without major bugs. In the future we would be much more willing to undertake planning and keep using tools such as Trello more consistently.

Challenges:
* The main expected challenge our group faced was the problem of team members different skill levels as some members were more comfortable with React or Node than others. We overcame these challenges by assigning different parts of the app to different members, working on parts in groups where team members helped each other and by informing each other if we were having trouble and needed assistance.
* The main unexpected challenge was the problem of where different team members lived, which made cooperation at times difficult. We overcame these problems by creating a Slack channel, using tools such as Trello and arranging times to meet face to face. The use of Slack and Trello allowed us to know where each member was up to and made cooperating much easier.
* In the future, to address these challenges we agreed to have specific times to meet, have different ways to contact each other and to have each other's phone numbers should the need arise.

Project Future:
* The additional work we will undertake for our app will be to present it to the client, and run through how it works with their staff to ensure they can use it.
* It will be presented to the client in approximately one week, when it best suits the client and then for the next 4 months we will continue to work on the app based on the clients requests for issues such as bugs, crashes or additional features.
* We will continue to work on it as a group, with online chat to maintain contact with each other for addressing issues with the app.

#### 11) Create a questionnaire for the client to ascertain the satisfaction with your products and services:
Our questionnaire will be based on the following questions below to obtain feedback from the client:
1. On a scale of 1 - 10 how happy are you with the quality of the service app provided by our group?
2. How satisfied have you been with the services provided by our group?
3. How satisfied have you been with the communication provided to you by our group?
4. What improvements would you suggest to improve our services next time?
5. How would you rate the quality of the product provided?
6. What parts of the product do you like the most?
7. What parts of the product did you think could be improved more?
8. What parts of the services did you like the most?
9. Would you consider our group the next time you wanted an app built?
10. Do you have any other final comments on how our team conducted ourselves?

## Application Design

#### 1) A 350 word summary of your application including problem definition and solution:
The problem our client was facing was the need to have a better system for human resource management as their current system relied on, shown in the client-setup folder. 

The solution our team came up with in order to address the client's problem was to create a new human resource style application which would be able to address a number of problems the client faced such as human error and time saving.

To design our solution, wireframes along with the expected user stories were drawn up and discussed. Our wireframes (in the wireframes folder) and basic user stories (in the user stories folder) show how when using React, we would envision the app looking along with the main features, a Rosters, Staff, and Timesheets while having two different views which would change depending on the user, staff and admin.

The main design of the app in React was to have 4 main components, ‘Staff’, ‘Rosters and Timesheets’, ‘Clock’ and ‘Logging’. Most of the components were designed this way based off of what different team members were focusing on and to avoid repeating code. Some of these components have sub-components dealing with factors such as table columns or heading but were carefully laid out so that different parts of the app could speak to each other when necessary and to keep the code as clean as possible.

The back end of the app was built using Node JS while the database is handled by MongoDB. The back end relied on the following models Entitlements, Flags, PayRateCatagories, StandardHours, User and Week. Each of these models and their routes were used for specific purposes, Eg User - contained staff information, Pin details and their staff role, which would be used by all of the main components on React.

When testing the app, a Seed file was created in the backend. The seed file contained dummy data based around the models and routes provided from Node. Using the dummy data, our team was able to see how the app would look when being used by the client.

#### 2) Review the conceptual design with the client and edit based on their feedback:
After meeting with the client meetings were arranged through emails informing them of the teams progress or if they wanted a part of the app to be changed. The images below shows one of the main interactions with the client and some of the changes which were based on their feedback.

Example 1:

#### 3) User stories for the whole application:
User stories were done using the online tool Trello:
